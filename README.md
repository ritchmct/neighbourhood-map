# Neighbourhood Map project

## The Challenge

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

## The Implementation

### Installation

### Scripts

**model.js** - contains the initial data about the places in addition to the AJAX calls to the Yelp and Foursquare APIs to retrieve additional data.
<br>
**viewModel.js**
<br>
**viewMap.js**
<br>

### Libraries

[Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) - Used in the implementation of the list of places<br>
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - Used for ajax calls in model.js and for ease of DOM manipulation in viewMap.js<br>
[oauth](https://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/) - JavaScript software for implementing an OAuth consumer. Author: John Kristian. Used to authorize AJAX calls to Yelp

### APIs

**Google Maps API**

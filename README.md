# Neighbourhood Map project

## The Challenge

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

## The Implementation

### Scripts

**model.js** - contains the initial data about the places in addition to the AJAX calls to the Yelp and Foursquare APIs to retrieve additional data
**viewModel.js**
**viewMap.js**

### Libraries

**knockout.js**
**jQuery**
**sha1**
**oauth**

### APIs

**Google Maps API**
**Yelp API**
**Foursquare API**

### Build
